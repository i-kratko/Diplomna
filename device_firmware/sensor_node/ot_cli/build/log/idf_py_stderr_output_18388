CMake Error at C:/Espressif/frameworks/esp-idf-v5.1.2/tools/cmake/build.cmake:540 (message):
  WARNING: 5 unexpected files and directories were found in the
  "managed_components" directory: bmp280 bh1750 esp_idf_lib_helpers i2cdev
  bme680

  Content of the managed components directory is managed automatically and
  it's not recommended to place any files there manually.  To suppress this
  warning set the environment variable:
  IGNORE_UNKNOWN_FILES_FOR_MANAGED_COMPONENTS=1

  ERROR: Some components (espressif/esp_ot_cli_extension) in the
  "managed_components" directory were modified on the disk since the last run
  of the CMake.  Content of this directory is managed automatically.

  If you want to keep the changes, you can move the directory with the
  component to the "components"directory of your project.

  I.E.  for "espressif__esp_ot_cli_extension" run:

  mv
  C:\Users\nikiy\Desktop\DR\Diplomna\device_firmware\sensor_node\ot_cli\managed_components\espressif__esp_ot_cli_extension
  C:\Users\nikiy\Desktop\DR\Diplomna\device_firmware\sensor_node\ot_cli\components\espressif__esp_ot_cli_extension


  Or, if you want to discard the changes remove the ".component_hash" file
  from the component's directory.

  I.E.  for "espressif__esp_ot_cli_extension" run:

  rm
  C:\Users\nikiy\Desktop\DR\Diplomna\device_firmware\sensor_node\ot_cli\managed_components\espressif__esp_ot_cli_extension\.component_hash
